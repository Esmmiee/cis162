<h2>Education</h2>
<p>As a first generation college student, I had to become resourceful in obtaining the aid I needed to have a successful academic life. In high school I made sure to join plenty of clubs/activities such as the female junior varsity soccer team, Junior State of America club, and Jazz Band. Additionally, I was enrolled in multiple advanced placement classes. As such, once I graduated high school I went on to attend CalStateLA and graduated with a BS in Political Science with emphasis on Public Administration and minored in Criminal Justice. Now, I want to continue my educational journey following a different path. I want to learn more about technology. I was always fascinated with our technological advances but I did not really understand it's concepts. This is my motivating factor in continuing my academic journey, the thirst to understand concepts that seem so foreign to me. </p>
