<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am Esmeralda Mercado-Navarro, and I am currently a student at Cerritos taking courses to become a computer programmer. I received my Bachelors in Political Science at CalStateLA. I currently work at a law firm dealing with personal injury cases. I've always been intrigued with technology so I decided to take initiative and take some courses. So far, I've taken 3 courses and I am absolutely loving it. I hope to complete my certification and continue my education journey into a Masters progam.</p>
    <h2>When I have free time</h2>
    <ol>
    <li>I like to go hiking with my little chihuaha</li>
    <li>I like reading philosophical and histrotical novels</li>
    <li>I like going to the gym for strength training</li>
    </ol>
<p>My favorite website is 
<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org">Geeks for Geeks</a> because it has greatly aided me in my studies!</p>
